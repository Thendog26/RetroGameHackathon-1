# Battle of the Snakes
Traditionally, Snake is a top down 'get the orbs and don't die by hitting your body'. What if we made a game where instead of it just being you, it's you vs an AI? 

The goal is simple, you start in the bottom right and the AI starts in the bottom left. Then you have to race each other to collect orbs and whoever gets the orb first gets a bigger snake and so forth. You win by making the AI walk into you so the goal would probably be to trick the AI somehow or get big/lucky enough that you can surround the AI, and then in theory you could also make profiles and make the AI learn using a form of machine learning (training from past matches with a base AI neral network) so that it learns your strategies and develops ways to overcome them. AI's training data is stored on whichever profile you played on. That way you need to constantly be thinking in new and innovative ways and it keeps the game interesting.
